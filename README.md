# PyBank & PyRamen
## Project Relevance
The goal of this project is to manipulate data sets to output useful information. For PyBank, that useful information includes total months, net <br> P/L, monthly avg P/L, and the Greatest P & L. For PyRamen, the analysis is more important on the individual product level, as data regarding <br> its success will help determine which products may need adjusting or to be removed.

## Game Plan
First I will take care of the data. I need to run a csv reader script for both files, so I should be able to copy one to use in the other project to <br> take care of that. I need to make sure the data is organized in a way that it is easier to code to pull the results I want to present. At this point, <br> the two projects will be handled slightly different, since the data sets are organized differently and will also be used to present different <br> information.

I could potentially set up the analysis portion of coding before I do the import to save time, since we learned most of the setup for analysis <br> already.
